// Land Calculation.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
/* In the United States, land is often measured in square feet. In many other countries it is measured in square meters. 
One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. A square meter is equivalent to 10.7639 square feet. 
Write a program that computes and displays the number of square feet and the number of square meters in 1/4 acre of land.

Hint: Because a square meter is larger than a square foot, there will be fewer square meters in 1/4 acre than there are square feet.*/
